    <h2>Who developed the first NERF product?</h2><br>

     <p> PARKER BROTHERS originally developed NERF, beginning with a four inch polyurethane foam ball in 1969. The original 4-inch polyurethane foam ball was just dense enough to be hurled accurately but too light to cause damage. The ball was first released in 1970 in a small black box whose packaging urged, “Throw it indoors. You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.”</p>
